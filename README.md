hello this is luke. I'm determine to be the best options/future trader in the future. Did you know that I manage my own portfolio that is worth over half a million dollar! Isn't that exciting?! I am very tempting to buy the SPY and hold on to it but it is very difficult to make the plunge. It's like there are two thoughts debating inside my head; the greed saying that if you don't do this you will miss out the return everyone is getting, and the fear saying if I take the plunge, I might get in at the worse time and the stock market will go south and will lose my money.

If you look at it from outside, you would never understand. You won't get it, not until you get to manage your own money and risking your hard-earned money that can make your family and love ones have a better live.

this is me and thank you for reading.
